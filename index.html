    <p>The Rottweiler breed gets its name from Rottwiel, Germany, where they were used to herd cattle in 
            the Middle Ages. But their history is a lot older than that!
            The Rottweiler actually ended up in Germany because of the ancient Romans. As their armies tried 
            to conquer Europe, they brought thousands of cattle for food. Their Rottweilers were used as 
            herding dogs and eventually spread around Europe before becoming a favorite of cattle herders
           who sold their stock in Germany.  
           When the railroad and the cattle car were invented, Rottweilers lost their jobs as herders and almost 
           went extinct. Fortunately, the breed was kept alive because of their popularity as police and military 
           dogs. By the 1990s, they were ranked the second most popular purebred in the United States.
